# Strata Wiki

Welcome to the Strata Wiki!

This is the custom wiki software that powers the Wiki for most of our games. If you're looking to edit contents on the wiki, you may wish to check out [the main Wiki repository](https://github.com/StrataSource/wiki/).

## Quick Start

To quickly start developing on the wiki, run the following:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

This will boot up the dev server that allows you to develop with instant refresh.

> [!NOTE]  
> While the dev server is booting up, it'll execute a build of the full site and index it for the search. This may take a few minutes.
